This is a project I am currently working on where I 
am attempting to automatically generate large(1000x1000) 
nonograms/picross puzzles.

It involves some image color compression experiments at the moment
and as I progress, I will update it.

How to use
Place image files in the resources/input folder
Create the middle, final and compare folders also in resources
Create a txt file with colors in hex format seperated by newlines
The program will attempt to convert all images in input to
the specified color palette. Limited success at the moment...

Example {
#e4e7e1
#d5d6d9
#b2bcc1
}
